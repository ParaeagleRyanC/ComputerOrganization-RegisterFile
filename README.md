# Register File

The register file is another important component of any processor system. The register file stores the values of the registers used by the processor. Almost all instructions read from and/or write to the register file. 

This Register File is created to be used for the [Pipelined-Forwarding RISC-V Processor]().

This program demonstrates the knowledge and the ability to
* Create and operate multi-ported memories in SystemVerilog
* Create a synchronous multi-ported register file
